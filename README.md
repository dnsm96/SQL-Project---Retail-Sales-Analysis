## üìÇ Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE project_sql;
```

### üìã Table: `retail_sales`

```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

---

## üîç Data Exploration Queries

- View all data:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- Record count:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- Unique customer count:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- Category count and list:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category), ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT category) FROM retail_sales;
  ```

- Null check and cleanup:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

  DELETE FROM retail_sales WHERE
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
  ```

## üìä Analytical Queries

- Sales made on `2022-11-05`:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM retail_sales WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
  ```

- Clothing transactions with quantity ‚â• 4 in November 2022:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM retail_sales
  WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND quantity >= 4 AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11';
  ```

- Total sales by category:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sale
  FROM retail_sales
  GROUP BY category
  ORDER BY total_sale DESC;
  ```

- Average age of 'Beauty' category customers:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(age)) AS average_age
  FROM retail_sales
  WHERE category = 'Beauty'
  GROUP BY category;
  ```

- Transactions with sales > 1000:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM retail_sales
  WHERE total_sale > 1000
  ORDER BY total_sale DESC;
  ```

- Number of transactions by gender per category:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, gender, COUNT(transactions_id)
  FROM retail_sales
  GROUP BY category, gender
  ORDER BY category;
  ```

## üìÖ Monthly Analysis

- Average sale per month & best-selling month of each year:
  ```sql
  WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
           TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'FMMonth') AS month,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month_num,
           ROUND(AVG(total_sale)::numeric, 2) AS avg_sale
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY year, month, month_num
  ),
  cte2 AS (
    SELECT year, month, avg_sale,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY avg_sale DESC) AS rank
    FROM cte1
  )
  SELECT * FROM cte2 WHERE rank = 1;
  ```

## üèÜ Insights

- **Top 5 customers** by total sales:
  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sale
  FROM retail_sales
  GROUP BY customer_id
  ORDER BY total_sale DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

- **Unique customers** per category:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
  FROM retail_sales
  GROUP BY category;
  ```

- **Shift-based order count**:
  ```sql
  SELECT shift, COUNT(*) FROM (
    SELECT CASE
      WHEN sale_time < '12:00:00' THEN 'Morning'
      WHEN sale_time BETWEEN '12:00:00' AND '17:00:00' THEN 'Afternoon'
      ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales
  ) AS shifts
  GROUP BY shift;
  ```
